## What This Means

These inspections have client names starting with "**New**" which indicates:

1. **Placeholder Names** - These are generic placeholder names used when the actual client couldn't be matched
2. **Missing in Database** - The account codes exist on the SQL server but aren't in the Google Sheets client database
3. **Needs Attention** - These inspections need to be matched to real client names
