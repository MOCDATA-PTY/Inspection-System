## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. ❌ COMMODITY TYPE MISMATCH

**The Problem:**
- **Facility Registration:** AB-IND-RAW-NA-3420
  - `AB` = Abattoir
  - `IND` = Independent
  - `RAW` = **RAW meat facility** ← MISMATCH HERE
  - `NA` = National
  - `3420` = Facility ID

- **Actual Inspections:** All 5 are POULTRY commodity
- **Products Inspected:** All chicken products

**Analysis:**
The account code explicitly states this is a RAW meat facility, but 100% of inspections are for POULTRY products. This is impossible unless:

1. The account code is wrong (should be AB-IND-POULTRY-NA-3420 or AB-IND-PTY-NA-3420)
2. The inspections are being assigned to the wrong facility
3. The facility changed commodity type but the account code wasn't updated

**Most Likely Cause:**
Based on the products (all chicken), Festive IS a poultry facility, so the account code in SQL Server is incorrect.

### 2. ⚠️ Missing Data

All 5 inspections are missing:
- KM Traveled (not recorded)
- Hours (not recorded)

### 3. ℹ️ Not Sent/Uploaded

All 5 inspections have not been:
- Marked as sent
- Uploaded to OneDrive

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Facility Type**
   - Contact Festive to confirm what commodity they actually process
   - If they process poultry: Update account code in SQL Server to AB-IND-POULTRY-NA-3420

2. **Update Account Code in SQL Server**
   ```sql
   UPDATE AFS.dbo.Clients
   SET InternalAccountNumber = 'AB-IND-POULTRY-NA-3420'
   WHERE Id = 3420 AND Name = 'Festive'
   ```

3. **Re-sync After Correction**
   - After fixing SQL Server, run: `python manage.py sync_inspections`
   - Verify the account code is now correct

### Follow-up Actions:

1. **Complete Missing Data**
   - Enter KM traveled for these inspections
   - Enter hours worked

2. **Process Inspections**
   - Review and mark as sent when appropriate
   - Upload to OneDrive if required

3. **Run Full Commodity Mismatch Audit**
   - Check all facilities for similar mismatches
   - Create a list of facilities needing account code corrections

## Data Quality Notes

### Positive Findings:

✅ All inspections now have `internal_account_code` populated (after the fix)
✅ Inspector information is complete and consistent
✅ GPS coordinates captured for all inspections
✅ Time tracking is complete (start/end times)
✅ Products properly identified

### Areas for Improvement:

⚠️ Manual data entry needed (KM, hours)
⚠️ Commodity type validation in SQL Server
⚠️ Account code standardization and verification
