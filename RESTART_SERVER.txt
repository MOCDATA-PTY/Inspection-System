IMPORTANT: RESTART DJANGO SERVER
=================================

The duplicate inspection fix (OUTER APPLY) has been committed and pushed to GitHub,
but your Django server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

STEPS TO RESTART:
1. Stop your current Django server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Pull the latest changes from GitHub (if on production server):
   git pull origin master
3. Start the Django server again:
   python manage.py runserver

WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
- Django loads Python code into memory when it starts
- Code changes don't take effect until the server is restarted
- Your server is currently running the OLD query with JOIN
- After restart, it will use the NEW query with OUTER APPLY

WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER RESTART:
- Web sync button will use the fixed query
- Syncing will create ~3.1k inspections (correct)
- No more duplicates from GPS records
- Direction data will sync properly

Current Status:
✅ Fix committed: 5b798a4 "Fix duplicate inspection records caused by GPS table JOIN"
✅ OUTER APPLY in all 6 commodity queries
❌ Server still running old code from memory
→  RESTART NEEDED!

After restarting, test by clicking "Sync Everything" button.
It should maintain ~3.1k inspections instead of jumping to 6.8k.
