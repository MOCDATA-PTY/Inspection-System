Subject: Inspections Missing Internal Account Codes - Action Required

To: Eclick Team
From: Food Safety Inspection System
Date: November 17, 2025

Dear Eclick Team,

We have identified 8 inspections in our system that cannot be matched to clients due to missing or invalid internal account codes.

ISSUE 1: November 3, 2025 (5 inspections)
Inspector: KUTLWANO KUNTWANE
Problem: No internal account code on the server - shows as "-"

Remote IDs: 6117, 8274, 9642, 9644, 9647

These inspections have no account code in the SQL Server database. The account code field contains only "-" which prevents us from matching them to clients in our Google Sheets database.


ISSUE 2: November 14, 2025 (3 inspections)
Inspector: MOKGADI SELONE
Problem: Account code "RE-COR-RAW-FLM-1805" not found in Google Sheets client database

Remote IDs: 6320, 8472, 9910

These inspections have the account code "RE-COR-RAW-FLM-1805" on the server, but this account code does not exist in our Google Sheets client list.


IMPACT:
- Client name shows as "-" instead of actual client information
- Lab results cannot be properly linked to clients
- These inspections cannot be included in client-specific reports


REQUIRED ACTION:

For November 3 inspections:
Please update the SQL Server database with the correct internal account codes for these 5 inspections.

For November 14 inspections:
Please either add the client with account code "RE-COR-RAW-FLM-1805" to the Google Sheets client database, OR provide the correct account code if "RE-COR-RAW-FLM-1805" is incorrect.


Once updated, our next sync will automatically correct the client associations.

Please let us know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Food Safety Inspection System Team
